CommentSmoker is a Bot designed in Python to scan comments on Stack Overflow. It accesses these via the [Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com), and then posts them to chat using [Botpy](https://github.com/SOBotics/Botpy).

CommentSmoker is currently running on an Raspberry Pi 3B, on Python 3.5

This is a project for me to learn Python, so the coding quality is sub-par at best. Use at your own risk! Any improvements welcome.

### TODO
 - Add start on any site
 - Enable/Disable reasons on the fly
 - Multiprocessing
